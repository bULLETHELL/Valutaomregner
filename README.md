Made with php, js and HTML5. Uses XHR to get xml-file from server. I use this technology because it works well in JavaScript. 
I get the XML-file from the webservice using a php-script to avoid CORS. I used bootstrap and a css framework which allows me to display flags based on the currency, which I get from the XML-file. I used Bootstrap because it works well and is easy to use and makes the website look nice, simple and modern.
